# Introduction
HDUOJ was generated from the Hangzhou Dianzi University Online Judge platform http://acm.hdu.edu.cn.

This dataset has a similar format to other datasets:

The first line represents the total number of questions answered by students.

The second line represents the sequence of students' questions.

The third line represents the sequence of students' answers

# Format
Same as any other dataset,The HDUOJ dataset has five seeds corresponding to training sets 1-5,validation sets 1-5 and a test set. 

Because of the limitation of file size.We compress training sets 1-3 in one file,training sets 4-5 and test sets in one file,
and finally validation sets 1-5 in one file.
